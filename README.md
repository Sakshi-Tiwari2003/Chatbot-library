## Technical Details

### Sentence Embeddings
The chatbot uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from sentence-transformers to:
- Convert questions into 384-dimensional embeddings
- Perform semantic similarity matching using cosine similarity
- Understand synonyms and different phrasings of the same question

### Performance Optimizations
- **Embedding Caching**: Pre-computed embeddings are cached in `question_embeddings.pkl`
- **Smart Fallback**: Short queries (< 3 characters) use string matching
- **Automatic Cache Refresh**: Cache is cleared when new Q&A pairs are added
